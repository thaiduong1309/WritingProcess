For decades, scientists and engineers have studied to find a renewable, green energy to replace fossil fuel as they’re running out.
The solar panels are made of solar cells (a small disk of a semiconductor like silicon). They are attached by wire to a circuit. As light strikes the semiconductor, light is converted into electricity that flows through the circuit. They are called "solar" panels because, the most powerful source of light available is our Sun. 
However, the amount of Sun's light reach to terrestrial solar on Earth's surface is hardly restrict from the clouds, atmosphere and nighttime. Satellite-based solar panels, in the other hand, are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in huge quantities. It works regardless of cloud cover, daylight. 
Large scale in-orbit construction and operations. To gather massive quantities of energy, solar power satellites must be large, far larger than the International Space Station (ISS), the largest spacecraft built to date. Fortunately, solar power satellites will be simpler than the ISS as they will consist of many identical parts. 
Power transmission. A relatively small effort is also necessary to assess how to best transmit power from satellites to the Earth’s surface with minimal environmental impact. 
Space solar power can be exported to virtually any place in the world, and its energy can be converted for local needs — such as manufacture of methanol for use in places like rural India where there are no electric power grids. Space solar power can also be used for desalination of sea water

Space solar power can provide a market large enough to develop the low-cost space transportation system that is required for its deployment. This, in turn, will also bring the resources of the solar system within economic reach.
The Space Solar Power Systems project is a space-based solar power plant that generates energy by collecting sunlight in geostationary orbit. The energy is then transmitted to the ground, and converted into electricity and hydrogen for practical use. SSPS consists of a space-based power generation/transmission facility that gathers sunlight, converts it into microwaves or laser beams, and transmits those to the ground; and a power receiving facility on the ground.
